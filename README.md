# CoreHapticsTests
*Work in progress*

This is an ios app designed to make core haptics more simple to run in an app. 

Core haptics is difficult and clunky to use, this program is aimed at letting people create haptic patterns and feel them on the phone before exporting them for use in other apps. The goal is to leave a system in place that can be part of the [PeteBits package](https://github.com/PeterH33/PeteBits), using something like a json file to store and share new haptic events.

## Main page
The main page will have buttons and labels that will let the user of the app feel the various haptics stored in and enabled by the HapticManager class

## Editor
*NOTE Not Yet Implemented*

This page will let a user play with settings and design a new haptic, and finally save that haptic in a json file that will be able to be exported for use in other projects that use the [PeteBits package](https://github.com/PeterH33/PeteBits).
